//! `add_team_from_catalog`: copy another owner's published team into the local
//! stores, atomically.
//!
//! Two properties define this command, and both are amendment requirements:
//!
//! **The frontend is not trusted (A2).** The caller supplies only a
//! coordinate — owner pubkey, team d-tag, and the event id it is looking at.
//! The backend re-fetches the CURRENT head at `30178:<owner>:<d>` from the
//! active relay and requires it to be the same event, still carrying the
//! `shared` tag. A head that cannot be established at all is a failure, not a
//! fallback: adding from a coordinate we cannot read is exactly the case where
//! a retracted or superseded team would be copied.
//!
//! **The write is all-or-nothing.** Both stores are snapshotted under the
//! store lock and restored wholesale on any failure, so a partial add can
//! never leave orphan member copies behind or a reactivated copy stranded in
//! the active list.
//!
//! Everything about the projection itself — the schema, the size contract,
//! the member shape — is `managed_agents::team_catalog`'s; this module only
//! verifies provenance and writes records.

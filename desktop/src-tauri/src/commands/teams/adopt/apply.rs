//! The store-mutation half of `add_team_from_catalog`: turn a verified
//! projection into local records, all-or-nothing.
//!
//! The whole mutation is computed in memory by [`plan_add`] before anything is
//! written, so no failure in resolving members can leave a half-added team on
//! disk. Only the two saves themselves remain, and the first succeeding while
//! the second fails is covered by restoring both snapshots wholesale — a total
//! rollback rather than a best-effort undo of the rows we remember touching,
//! which matters for a member copy that was reactivated rather than created
//! and whose "undo" is a field revert with no row to delete.
